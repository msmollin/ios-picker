## Installation Instructions

### For iOS Pros:

1. Get an API Key
  - Go to [Filepicker.io](www.filepicker.io) to register an account.
  - API Keys are typically randomized and 20 characters long.

2. Insert the framework and bundle
  - Clone the repository with `git clone --recursive git@github.com:Ink/ios-picker.git`
  - Under `/dist`, you'll find `FPPicker.framework` and `FPPicker.bundle`.
  - Drag both into your project, typically into your Frameworks group folder.
  - Choose to `Copy items into Destination Folder`

3. Add other framework dependencies

  - Under `Build Phases > Link Binary with Libraries`, add the following:
    - `AssetsLibrary.framework`
    - `CoreFoundation.framework`
    - `CoreGraphics.framework`
    - `Foundation.framework`
    - `MobileCoreServices.framework`
    - `QuartzCore.framework`
    - `SystemConfiguration.framework`
    - `UIKit.framework`

  - Your list should look now like this *(double-check that `FPPicker.framework` is included)*:

4. Settings
  - Go to `Your app's target` > `Info` > `Custom iOS Target Properties` and add the following key/value pair:

    ```
    Key: "Filepicker API Key"
    Value: YOUR_API_KEY (that you got from step 1)
    ```

  - Your list should now look like this:

5. Using it
  1. `#import <FPPicker/FPPicker.h>` into your `ViewController.h` or anywhere else you may want to use Filepicker.

  2. Instantiate the object
    ```objc
    FPPickerController *fpController = [FPPickerController new];
    fpController.fpdelegate = self;
    ```
  3. Implement the delegate methods
    ```objc
    #pragma mark - FPPicker Delegate Methods

    - (void)FPPickerController:(FPPickerController *)picker didFinishPickingMediaWithInfo:(NSDictionary *)info
    {
      // Handle accordingly
    }

    - (void)FPPickerControllerDidCancel:(FPPickerController *)picker
    {
      // Handle accordingly
    }
    ```
