### Starting from Scratch

1. Get an API Key
  - Go to [Filepicker.io](www.filepicker.io) to register an account.
  - API Keys are typically randomized and 20 characters long.

2. Start a new Project
  - `File` > `New` > `Project` or `Shift-Apple + N`
  - Choose `Single View Project`

  - Device Family: iPad
  - Use Storyboards: YES
  - Use Automatic Reference Counting: YES

3. Insert the framework and bundle
  - Clone the repository with `git clone --recursive git@github.com:Ink/ios-picker.git`
  - Under `/dist`, you'll find `FPPicker.framework` and `FPPicker.bundle`.
  - Drag both into your project, typically into your Frameworks group folder.

  - Choose to `Copy items into Destination Folder`

4. Add other framework dependencies
  - Under `Build Phases > Link Binary with Libraries`, add the following:
    - `AssetsLibrary.framework`
    - `CoreFoundation.framework`
    - `CoreGraphics.framework`
    - `Foundation.framework`
    - `MobileCoreServices.framework`
    - `QuartzCore.framework`
    - `SystemConfiguration.framework`
    - `UIKit.framework`
  - Your list should look now like this *(double-check that `FPPicker.framework` is included)*:

5. Add "-ObjC" to Other Linker Flags
  - Under `Build Settings > Linking`, locate `Other Linking Flags` and add `-ObjC`.

6. Settings
  - Go to `Your app's target` > `Info` > `Custom iOS Target Properties` and add the following key/value pair:

    ```
    Key: "Filepicker API Key"
    Value: YOUR_API_KEY (that you got from step 1)
    ```
  - Your list should now look like this:

7. Write the code
  - You can copy and paste the following code into your `ViewController.h` and `ViewController.m` respectively.
  - In `ViewController.h`
      - We create a button, imageview, and a popover
  - In `ViewController.m`
      - We create an action when the button is pressed
      - We also have two delegates that respond when the Filepicker is finished.
  - [ViewController.h Source](https://github.com/Filepicker/ios/blob/develop/FPPicker Demo/FPPicker Demo/ViewController.h)
  - [ViewController.m Source](https://github.com/Filepicker/ios/blob/develop/FPPicker Demo/FPPicker Demo/ViewController.m)

8. Build the User Interface
  - Drag a 'Image View' and a 'Button' from the objects draw on the right.

  - Hook up the proper interfaces
      - Connect the `Image View` to the `View Controller`'s `imageView` outlet.
      - Connect the `Button` to the `View Controller`'s `pickerAction:` action.
