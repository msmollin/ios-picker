### Starting from Scratch

1. Get an API Key
  - Go to [Filepicker.io](www.filepicker.io) to register an account.
  - API Keys are typically randomized and 20 characters long.

2. Start a new Project
  - `File` > `New` > `Project` or `Shift-Apple + N`
  - Choose `Single View Project`

3. Add `FPPicker` to your `Podfile`
  ```ruby
  platform :ios, '6.0'

  target :'MyImagesApp' do
    pod 'FPPicker', '~> 3.0.0'
  end
  ```

4. Run `pod install`

5. Settings
  - Go to `Your app's target` > `Info` > `Custom iOS Target Properties` and add the following key/value pair:

    ```
    Key: "Filepicker API Key"
    Value: YOUR_API_KEY (that you got from step 1)
    ```
  - Your list should now look like this:

6. Write the code
  - You can copy and paste the following code into your `ViewController.h` and `ViewController.m` respectively.
  - In `ViewController.h`
      - We create a button, imageview, and a popover
  - In `ViewController.m`
      - We create an action when the button is pressed
      - We also have two delegates that respond when the Filepicker is finished.
  - [ViewController.h Source](https://github.com/Filepicker/ios/blob/develop/FPPicker Demo/FPPicker Demo/ViewController.h)
  - [ViewController.m Source](https://github.com/Filepicker/ios/blob/develop/FPPicker Demo/FPPicker Demo/ViewController.m)

7. Build the User Interface
  - Drag a 'Image View' and a 'Button' from the objects draw on the right.

  - Hook up the proper interfaces
      - Connect the `Image View` to the `View Controller`'s `imageView` outlet.
      - Connect the `Button` to the `View Controller`'s `pickerAction:` action.
